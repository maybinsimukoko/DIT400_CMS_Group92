######  **AI Prompt for C++ to Java Conversion**



\## AI Prompt Used

"Convert this C++ console-based Course Management System to Java.  

Keep it console-based. Use arrays only for course storage.  

Do not use structs, classes, vectors, maps, or advanced libraries.  





###### **Code Changes Accepted**

1\. 

&nbsp;  - Using `String\[]` for course IDs and titles, and `int\[]` for credit hours.  

&nbsp;  - Reason: Direct translation of C++ parallel arrays; follows assignment rules.

2\.  

&nbsp;  - Using `FileReader`/`BufferedReader` and `FileWriter`/`BufferedWriter` for reading and writing files.  

&nbsp;  - Reason: Matches simple C++ file I/O style, beginner-friendly, avoids advanced Java libraries.



###### **Code Changes Rejected**  

&nbsp; 1. - Using Java `ArrayList` or any collection classes for courses.  

&nbsp;  - Reason: Assignment strictly requires arrays only; collections are not allowed.
